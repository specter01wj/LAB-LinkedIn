/*
 * This challenge computes and displays the total charges for a hospital stay
 * The patient might be admitted overnight.  For an overnight stay, we need: 
 *   The number of days spent in the hospital
 *   The daily rate
 *   Medication charges
 *   Lab service charges
 * If it is not overnight, we only need: 
 *   Medication charges
 *   Lab service charges
