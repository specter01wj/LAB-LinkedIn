<h3>Winter Wonderland at Landon Hotel in Vienna Draws Crowds (December 10, 2013)</h3>

<p>The Landon Hotel has created a winter wonderland for travelers visiting their Eighth District Landon in Vienna. Complete with a sledding hill and holiday vendors market, the spectacle delivers a unique and complete holiday experience for kids and adults alike.</p>

<p>Snowfall in Vienna provides the perfect landscape for Winter Wonderland at the Landon Hotel.  Travelers and locals alike can enjoy the winter activities such as sledding, ice skating, and snowman contests, taking place at the Eighth District Landon hotel. There is also a holiday vendors market, providing winter and holiday treats for visitors.</p>

<p>The early winter snow has been well-received by guests at the hotel. Maryse Buchleitner, a native to Vienna, brought her children, ages six and eight, to the event on a cold winter's day. "It's easy to get cooped up in the house during the winter, and it's nice to have a place like this to take the children when it's so cold outside. The kids are very excited to go ice skating, and I really enjoy shopping for holiday items at the market."</p>

<p>This is the third year that the Landon Hotel has held the Winter Wonderland event, and this year Jennifer Veladoner, President of Landon Hotel, Europe decided to make it a permanent tradition. "Our Winter Wonderland has been well received by the public, and by our guests. We've even seen a trend of repeat visitors, who come annually to stay at the hotel and participate in the event. We plan to host Winter Wonderland every year, and expand to add new activities and experiences in the future. This year we've added live music on Saturdays, and a children's fair on Sundays."</p>

<p>The Winter Wonderland is open daily from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, through January 15th.</p>
